## Heterogeneous Multilayer network for Multi-omics Single-cell data 

HuMMuS exploits multi-omics single-cell measurements to infer numerous regulatory relationships.


Beside classical Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN), HuMMus propose enhancer predictions, binding regions prediction and even broad communities detection.
Both paired and unpaired modalities can be used.
