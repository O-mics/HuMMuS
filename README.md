### Heterogeneous Multilayer network for Multi-omics Single-cell data 

HuMMuS exploits multi-omics single-cell measurements to infer numerous regulatory relationships.
Beside classical Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN), HuMMus propose enhancer predictions, binding regions prediction and even broad communities detection.

We propose two ways of using HuMMuS : 

## **scRNA + scATAC** 

Like most of the current state-of-the-art method to infer Gene Regulatory Networks, we popose a minimal version of HuMMuS based on scRNA-seq + scATAC-seq data (paired or **unpaired**).

## **3 single-cell omics** : scRNA + scATAC + **scMethylation**
HuMMuS has been developed to be extendable to any additional biological modality of interest.
We propose a standard adaptation of this framework to integration single-cell methylation.


_A future development of the package should also allow integration of personalised proteomics data to reploace the general protein-protein interactions we are currently using._
